    "# Understanding Scandal Formation Through the Bétharram Affair\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how scandals evolve from isolated incidents to national controversies using the theoretical framework studied in class. While the *Affaire Bétharram* is used as a case example—either hypothetical or real—it illustrates the mechanics of scandal escalation: from media involvement to public defections, legal interplay, and moral narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts include:\n",
    "- Desectorization (blurring of social boundaries)\n",
    "- Credible accusations and insider defections\n",
    "- Media framing\n",
    "- Moral symbolism"

    "## What Is a Scandal?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to sociologist Michel Dobry, scandals are not just about wrongdoing; they result from how events spread across different social \"sectors\"—law, politics, media, and public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Desectorization**: Legal and political spheres overlap.\n",
    "- **Credibility**: Whistleblowers and insider information validate claims.\n",
    "- **Media's Role**: Not just reporting but framing, amplifying, and moralizing.\n",
    "- **Symbolism**: Scandals reflect deeper societal concerns like trust, power, and justice."

    "## Case Analysis: Bétharram Affair\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not deeply covered in course material, the Bétharram affair fits the general scandal pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If insiders leaked information (e.g., abuse in a religious institution), credibility rises.\n",
    "- Media coverage shapes the narrative: is it a tabloid story or a national concern?\n",
    "- If political or institutional actors respond, the case becomes a broader public issue.\n",
    "- Public reactions (demonstrations, online campaigns) signify moral engagement.\n",
