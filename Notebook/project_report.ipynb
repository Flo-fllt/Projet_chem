    "The following Jupyter notebook briefly presents RetroChem, a pip-installable Python package designed for retrosynthetic analysis. This package was developed to assist chemists in predicting possible synthetic pathways for target molecules, using reaction templates and molecular fingerprints. Retrosynthesis is a central concept in organic chemistry, enabling the design of efficient synthetic routes by working backward from the desired product.\n",
