    "The following Jupyter notebook briefly presents RetroChem, a pip-installable Python package designed for retrosynthetic analysis. This package was developed to assist chemists and chemical engineers in predicting possible synthetic pathways for target molecules, using a machine learning model trained on the USPTO_50K database. Retrosynthesis is a central concept in organic chemistry, enabling the design of efficient synthetic routes by working backward from the desired product.\n",

    "This package was created as a collaborative project for the EPFL course Practical Programming in Chemistry.
